# Block Explorer

Testnet Token Bounty Size: **75MM to 125MM**

## Description

A dashboard that displays transactional and account data on the network.

Examples include Ethscan, Algoexplorer or Algoscan.

### What

A web based block explorer that is free for users to interact with in order to explore the written blocks on the network.

### Why

Users of the network need to be able to read data written to the blocks from the network. This enables the transparent nature of the network to be accessible to all users.

## Problem Statement

There is currently no user-friendly interface for users to be able to read data from the Voi network or for applications in the ecosystem to provide links to users of transactions that occurred. 

## Minimum Requirements
